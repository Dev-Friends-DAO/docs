# Intro

Dev Friends DAO is a place where product dev roles get together and build Web3 projects as a DAO.

In this docs, we define missions and guidelines as a DAO.

## Background

As of 2022, Web3 and DAOs get popular but still they're in an imature phase.

In terms of Web3, there should be lots of products and services replacing Web2 counterparts and many modules are needed.
About DAO, same things applies and DAO's ecosystem is not defined that much and in some area systems are broken and not cool, so fundamentally thinking there should be more components and modules for DAOs.

We, as a DAO, tackle this issue at the same time pursuring how it should be as a DAO.
This means we build things but also research Web3 and DAO routinely.

## By DAO we mean

DAO's definition varies from person to person, which is because DAO has changed its shape day by day.
However, because we lose sense if we all stop thinking and see one type of DAO as a definite DAO, so it's really important that we predefine.

As a DAO, we mean
- we prefer onchain identity/data/activity as much as possible, rather than offchain
- we prefer permissionlessness, transparency as much as possible, about things that should be
- we prefer essential activities and validation, rather than pessimistic motivation and discussion; we welcome productive criticism
- we all try to adopt and build fair, cool ecosystem, as technically as possible
- there's no illogical discrimination as a person; which means kind of meritocracy but fair
- we value autonomous motivation and actions; basically we all can't force someone about working time
- we can communicate and move things forward asyncronously
- there are clear roles and basically Dev Friends DAO's direction is determined by core team members
- ragequit is welcome and we all appreciate active contributions until then
