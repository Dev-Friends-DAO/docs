# Some prospects

We can't assert we will do these in the future 100%, but here's some prospects we might do.<br />
We think community design is really important and it should take time.<br />

- **DAO to DAO (D2D) and Dapp to DApp relationship R&D**<br />
Of course, we're thinking about collaboration with many projects out there, but with DAOs we can more accelerate and deepen our R&D.
- **token gated community**<br />
Not to mention.
- **R&D about being early adapters**<br />
With Web3, we think early adapters of products and services can enjoy more merits.
- **R&D about nurturing and educating investors and users, and how projects can build truly motivative communities**<br />
In today's Web3 world, investors and users are behaving in a not best way, but this has not been only their faults and neither have projects.<br />
We think knowledge and system are lacking.
- **R&D about Web3 adoption**<br />
Web3 projects have been tackling this issue and still significant answers are not in the market.
