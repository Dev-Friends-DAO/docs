# Tokenomics

We're working on this, but here's current thoughts.<br />

We should start thinking about the tokenomics when it's really needed and it shouldn't be used for capital gain especially in the initial phase, otherwise the tokenomics will break. **Tokenomics only work in the truly functioning economy, which is why we think building products and subDAOs, making a truly functioning DAO and culture/economy is more important.** That's right, DFD is not a place for freeriders.

That said, we're contemplating the tokenomics working in only this DAO, to govern and work better.
