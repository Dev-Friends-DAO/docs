# Joining Process

DFD is a DAO, but this doesn't mean everyone can join as a member with important roles without DFD members' judges.<br />
We believe if you're a possible person who might be suitable to this DAO, you can understand this.<br />
Product Dev DAO can't accommodate a large numbers of people that much in the first place, because we think the number of people who fit to this DAO is not large; if it's true there are already many Product Dev DAOs like DFD but not. Today's "DAOs" known as "Service DAOs" are communities for scaling services actually, with a mother behind who enjoy actual profits. We don't see them DAOs. DAO concept didn't get born for marketing.

However, we want to build our mediating organizational, systematic infrastructure with web3 and other awesome techs in a long time. In some day we might accomodate more people than we expect now.
