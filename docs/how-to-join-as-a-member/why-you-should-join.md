# Why you should join

If you are a builder who have experiences of building your own things or bootstraping/joining a startup, you should have thought more than once like this. 
- "If I were to work with cooperative and professional fellows, talking about awesome techs and products all the time"
- "I just wanted to build awesome things but now what I do is manageing and taking responsibility about what I don't care that much"
- "I built it, they didn't that much works! Ah I wanted to be born in a fair society where contributions are fairly evaluated"
- "I can build awesome things by myself, but to be honest I need friends and fellows who are flexible and be there when I come up with a great and big idea. I don't have friends or it's kind of hard to catch fantastic people fast every time I need them. Maybe I need a great network"
- "I have worked in companies in both full-time and freelance way, but all are not suitable to me to be honest"
- "I got fluttered with the concept of DAO, but almost all of the DAOs in society is just a rehash of what has been done before, which doesn't feel DAO and they just used the DAO word for buzz-marketing"
- "That DAO I felt was cool at first turned into just a kind of agency or educating community".<br />

Then, you might be comfortable in this DAO.<br />
**We love big, socially and technically meaningful impacts, and to make it happen, we do build 10x awesome products in a 10x awesome organization.**<br />
For this reason, **DFD prefer long-time contributors, rather than short-time**.
